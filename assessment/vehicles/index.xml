&lt;p>&lt;strong>In teams of two&lt;/strong>, design algorithms using flowcharts to create an automated, driverless vehicle that can:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>stop at a line,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>follow a line, and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>travel between two lines.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Explore how an automated vehicle might be guided along a road or track and how line detection could be used to save lives. Design ways to improve driving safety by helping to prevent drivers from falling asleep and causing an accident.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="task-description">Task Description&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You will need to complete all the following sections as part of your collaborative presentation:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Drive and stop at a line
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Design a flowchart for the automated vehicle to stop at a line.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Working code with comments&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Validation video&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Following a line
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Design a flowchart for the automated, driverless vehicle to follow a line.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Working code with comments&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Validation video&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Explain how an automated vehicle might be guided along a road or track.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once the wheeled robot is following the line, can it be improved to behave more like a car (i.e., move in a straight line rather than a wiggle)?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Detecting lane changes
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>To simulate what could happen if a driver falls asleep while driving, your robot could sound an alarm signal when it crosses the line. Program your robot to perform this function. Add you working code with comments.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What can happen if a driver falls asleep while driving?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How can we detect when a driver is falling asleep?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How could you improve your program?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Extension&lt;br/>
Simulate a vehicle’s behaviour at traffic lights by having their wheeled robot respond to a series of green and red signals. Placing the code inside a loop allows for the possibility of multiple “traffic lights” along a track. Use the technic beams available in the EV3 core set to simulate green and red lights. Place the beams on the table so the Color Sensor can detect them while rolling over them.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Appropriate protocols when taking a photos/videos of others.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Plan and implement consistent and logical navigation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Include hyperlinks to navigate the presentation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reference sources appropriately&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Complete at least all items of first 3 parts of this task.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>In teams of two&lt;/strong>, you will design algorithms using flowcharts to create an automated, driverless vehicle that can navigate an obstacle course. You will then adapt your code to use a touch sensor and an ultrasonic sensor to complete the same course, and make comparisons between the solutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This challenge features a sequence of turns that the robot must perform in order to get to the &amp;ldquo;end&amp;rdquo; of the course. The robot must begin at the starting point and get to the goal area by completing turning and forward movement behaviours. The robot must &lt;em>not&lt;/em> cross any lines.&lt;/p>
