Here are some things to try if your program won't run on
the EV3.

1. Check that the **shebang** line hasn't been mangled. It is easy to add a space to the left or a line above, and that
will break it.
2. Make sure all the **plugs** are properly seated in their
sockets by pushing them in a little bit.
If you hear a click, that one wasn't in properly,
but should be now!
3. Check that the **sensors** and **motors** that you've
declared in your program are actually plugged in to the
ports you have said they are.
If not, you can either rewire them so they match the program,
or change the program to match the wiring.
4. Plug the robot back into the computer and reconnect it.
Use the debugging mode: Run > Start Debugging, and there
should be a helpful message at the bottom of the window
about what is confusing the computer.
