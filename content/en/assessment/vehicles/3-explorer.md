title: "3: Robotics explorer"
---
**In teams of two**, your task is to design and program an autonomous robot that can explore and navigate its way around a room by avoiding walls and other obstacles before running into them. Your robot must have the capacity to carry a small camera or mobile phone.

## To Be Successful 
Your team must complete a working robot and documentation that includes:

- Defining
- Collaborating and managing
- Designing
- Implementing
- Evaluating

Include comments with your all Python code. Use appropriate programming structures (selection and iteration). In detail, you must each complete the documentation in your OneNote.

## Purpose
Students apply their coding skills and iterative project techniques to collaboratively identify, deconstruct, design and create an autonomous robot that uses sensors to explore a room.

## Learning Behaviours
This task provides the following opportunities to develop and demonstrate the Learner Behaviours:

Driven
: Engages in Python coding challenges with persistence and learns from their mistakes and willingly completes the extension activities.

Curious
: Explores and tests ideas by asking questions, researching and through trial and error when learning new skills or developing solutions

Collaborative
: Works in teams to solve problems and create new information. Willingly shares new skills and knowledge and assists others and seeks assistance from peers.

Connected
: Connects programming constructs and data structures to real life applications and is able to explore and discuss issues and ethical implications of their solution

Flexible Thinker
: Applies new knowledge and skills to solve problems and is able to adapt and recognize patterns in other solutions

Disciplined
: Motivated learner who demonstrates initiative by following a project management process to complete a project
